ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction
ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on their demographic and travel information.
We use the famous Titanic dataset and demonstrate the full workflow: data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Understand and explore the Titanic dataset.

Clean the data and handle missing values.

Encode categorical variables and scale numerical ones.

Train a Random Forest Classifier to predict survival.

Evaluate the model using various metrics.

Identify important features influencing survival.

ðŸ—ƒ Dataset
Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

Features used:

Pclass - Passenger Class (1, 2, 3)

Sex - Gender

Age - Age in years

SibSp - Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch - Number of parents/children aboard

Fare - Ticket fare

Embarked - Port of Embarkation (C, Q, S)

Target:

Survived (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

ðŸ”· Technologies & Libraries
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas

Scikit-learn

ðŸ“‹ Steps Performed
âœ… Data Loading: Loaded dataset directly from a public URL.
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized survival distribution & feature correlations.
âœ… Data Cleaning: Filled missing values and removed irrelevant columns.
âœ… Feature Engineering: Encoded categorical variables & created scaled feature set.
âœ… Model Training: Used Random Forest Classifier.
âœ… Model Evaluation: Measured performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
âœ… Feature Importance: Identified key features contributing to predictions.

ðŸ“ˆ Results
The model performed well on the test set and highlighted that gender, passenger class, and fare were among the most important predictors of survival.
